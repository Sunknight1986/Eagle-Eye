## Overview 
Eagle Eye is a mapping tool to let users identify the distribution of buildings with various height: Low-rise, High-rise, and Skyscrapers in a particualr city, and how they change overtime.
## Installation
For now the Eagle Eye is still A GH definition, you don't have to install but just run it through Grasshopper.

**NOTICE: Eagle Eye v0.2 is based on the latest plugin *Caribou*. If you are using older version, please update it otherwise Eagle Eye may not work.**

**Update on 30th Sep, 2021: release the v0.2.2 for users installed *Caribou* from PackageManager, remove the catagory 'Buildings without height data'.**
